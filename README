OPEN SOURCE SWITCH SOLUTION
----------------------------

   Its an small attempt to build the Open source Router-enabled Switch Solution.

   In open source community as per our knowledge we have different protocol stacks 
   runs as daemons, we don't have a complete solution. Here we are trying to build 
   the complete solution, instead of running each protocol as a single daemon.

   In the process of build open source switch solution I will using already existing 
   stacks available in the big open source world (thanks to the developers, please see 
   the AUTHORS file to know what are the open source stack we have used)to avoid simple 
   principle no to re-inventing the wheel.

Thanks
